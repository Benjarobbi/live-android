To join the two v.0.2 liveandroid .ISO files, you can use the COPY command in a command-prompt window: (similar commands exist for Mac OS X and Linux) * COPY /B liveandroidv0.2.iso.001 +liveandroidv0.2.iso.002 liveandroidv0.2.iso *

@liveandroid

Tried again in a Parallels virtual machine... When I run ifconfig specifying eth0 (sorry, not ipconfig!), I get an error message: ifconfig: SIOCSIFADDR no such device Looking in /system/etc/dhcpcd/dhcpcd.conf shows only a tiwlan0 interface. If I run ifconfig with this interface, I get the same error message. Looking the livedroid CD mentioned on the downloads page, the developer there does have networking working. If I type 'ifconfig' I get a response showing the eth0 interface. notice that in his boot sequence he runs a netcfg command. Hope this helps.

Hi, it can not boot on VirtualBox 3 on Debian testing AMD64 

@MurzNN

It boots on Ubuntu Jaunty AMD64 with Virtualbox 3.0 normally, but for networking you need to select adapter PCnet-FAST III instead of default.

How can be installed on a pendrive? 

@Apothh

For pendrive creation by terminal follow the next steps:

Install the required packages: syslinux, lilo (sudo apt-get install syslinux lilo)

Insert your pendrive with fat partition (!) in the next i call to /dev/sdb

Fix your MBR in the pen: sudo lilo -M /dev/sdb (not necessary)

Install syslinux bootloader to your partition: sudo syslinux -sf /dev/sdb1

Mount the liveandroid image: sudo mount -o loop <path to image> /cdrom

Mount your pendrive: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

Copy the android files: sudo cp /cdrom/ /mnt

Sync the pendrive: sudo sync

Rename isolinux.cfg: sudo mv /mnt/isolinux.cfg /mnt/syslinux.cfg

Umount your pen: sudo umount /mnt

Where is Android Market application? How I can install new applications? 

@Apothh

I think, this is the android 1.5 sdk version, and this is not containing the market applicatin. But you can use google to find .apk files.

@Androidguide

If you won't get any further than the splashscreen, try increasing the Base Memory (e.g. to 200MB) and Video Memory (e.g. to 64MB). For most users, this works.

@liveandroid

thanks!

I can't find the shortcut key to "Menu".

@cgarvey

The menu key is the Menu key on a Windows keyboard. It's the key (that usually is a logo of a drop down menu) to the right of the Windows key (with the Windows flag) to the right of the spacebar.
